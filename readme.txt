Adds very simple social sharing buttons for Twitter, Facebook and Google+ to the end of your posts.

== Description ==

= Social Sharing By Danny =

The simplest sharing links possible for Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

Most social sharing plugins are too ugly, heavy, complicated or poorly coded for my liking. This plugin aims to be different. Simple, lightweight and flexible.

= No script dependencies =

From itself, the buttons are actually plain text links which require <strong>NO external scripts</strong>. It makes no sense to load over 50 kilobytes of scripts and styles for a functionality 95% of your users will not use.

= Simple yet pretty & user-friendly  =

You can have the plugin load two very small files to add icons and a pop-up functionality to the sharing links. This way, users do not have to leave your website after clicking a sharing option. Loading of both files can be disabled so you can craft your own styles.

**Plugin Features**

- Sharing links for Twitter, Facebook and Google+
- Simple icon styles with a hover effect
- Simple script of just 600 bytes (not jQuery dependent) which will make the links open in a pop-up window.
- A shortcode and a template function to display the buttons anywhere you want.
- An overridable filter to set the condition for when to display the sharing links.
- Translation ready
